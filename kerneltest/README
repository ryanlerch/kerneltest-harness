Kernel-test web application
===========================

This is a small web application to display the results of the different
tests performed on kernels.

Requirements (as Fedora RPM):
- python-flask
- python-flask-wtf
- python-fedora-flask
- python-wtforms
- python-sqlalchemy
- python-openid
- python-openid-teams
- python-openid-cla


To run a development instance:

- Create the database
 $ python createdb.py

- Run the application
 $ python app.py

The application should be accessible at http//127.0.0.1:5000.

Hacking with Vagrant
--------------------

Quickly start hacking on kernel-tests using the vagrant setup that is included in the
repo is super simple.

First, install Ansible, Vagrant, the vagrant-sshfs plugin, and the vagrant-libvirt
plugin from the official Fedora repos::

    $ sudo dnf install ansible vagrant vagrant-libvirt vagrant-sshfs


Now, from within main directory (the one with the Vagrantfile in it) of your git
checkout of kerneltests, copy the ``Vagrantfile.example`` file to ``Vagrantfile``
and run the ``vagrant up`` command to provision your dev
environment::

    $ cp Vagrantfile.example Vagrantfile
    $ vagrant up

When this command is completed (it may take a while), Run the following command
on your host to start the server::

    $ vagrant ssh -c"cd /vagrant; ./runserver.py --host='0.0.0.0';"

Once that is running, simply go to http://localhost:5000/ in your browser on
your host to see your running kerneltests test instance.
